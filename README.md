2. ### What is a lambda expression?

    A lambda expression is a short way to express a function in Java. It allows us to write a function inline and pass it as an argument to another function as well.

3. ### What is a functional interface?

    A functional interface is an interface that contains exactly one abstract method. It is used to represent a single function contract.
